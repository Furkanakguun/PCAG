Multi-Particle Systems
======================

1. Introduction to Multi-Particle Systems
Multi-particle systems involve the study of many interacting particles, each with their own position, velocity, and properties. These systems are fundamental to understanding complex physical phenomena.

2. Center of Mass
The center of mass is the average position of all particles weighted by their masses:
- R_cm = (Σ m_i * r_i) / Σ m_i
- Motion of center of mass follows Newton's second law
- Internal forces cancel out in center of mass calculations

3. Particle Interactions
- Gravitational forces between particles
- Spring forces between connected particles
- Collision forces
- Electromagnetic forces (in advanced simulations)

4. Numerical Methods for Multi-Particle Systems
- Verlet integration for stability
- Leap-frog method
- Symplectic integrators for energy conservation
- Barnes-Hut algorithm for efficient N-body calculations

5. Collision Detection and Response
- Broad phase: Spatial partitioning
- Narrow phase: Precise collision detection
- Response: Impulse-based collision resolution
- Contact forces and friction

6. Constraint Systems
- Distance constraints between particles
- Angle constraints
- Collision constraints
- Soft constraints vs. hard constraints

7. Performance Optimization
- Spatial data structures (quadtrees, octrees)
- Level of detail (LOD) systems
- Parallel processing
- GPU acceleration

8. Applications
- Cloth simulation
- Fluid simulation
- Granular materials
- Molecular dynamics
- Crowd simulation
- Flocking behavior
