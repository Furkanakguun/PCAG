Vectors and Pygame
==================

1. Introduction to Vectors
Vectors are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. In game development and physics simulations, vectors are essential for representing positions, velocities, forces, and other directional quantities.

2. Vector Mathematics
- Vector addition and subtraction
- Scalar multiplication
- Dot product and cross product
- Vector magnitude and normalization
- Angle calculations

3. NumPy Vector Operations
```python
import numpy as np
# Create vectors
a = np.array([3, 4])
b = np.array([1, 2])
# Vector operations
c = a + b        # Addition
d = 2 * a        # Scalar multiplication
e = np.dot(a, b) # Dot product
```

4. Pygame Basics
Pygame is a Python library for creating games and multimedia applications:
- Display surfaces and windows
- Event handling
- Sprite management
- Collision detection
- Sound and music

5. Coordinate Systems
- Screen coordinates (top-left origin)
- World coordinates (custom origin)
- Coordinate transformations
- Camera systems

6. Sprite Programming
- Loading and displaying images
- Sprite animation
- Rotation and scaling
- Sprite groups and collision detection

7. Event Handling
- Keyboard input
- Mouse input
- Gamepad/joystick support
- Custom events

8. Graphics Programming
- Drawing primitives (lines, circles, rectangles)
- Color management
- Transparency and blending
- Performance optimization
