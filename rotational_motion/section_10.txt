Rotational Motion
=================

1. Introduction to Rotational Motion
Rotational motion involves objects spinning around an axis. This section covers angular kinematics, dynamics, and their applications in game development.

2. Angular Kinematics
- Angular position (θ): Angle of rotation
- Angular velocity (ω): Rate of change of angle
- Angular acceleration (α): Rate of change of angular velocity
- Relationship to linear motion: v = rω, a = rα

3. Moment of Inertia
The rotational equivalent of mass:
- I = Σ m_i * r_i²
- Depends on mass distribution around axis
- Parallel axis theorem: I = I_cm + Md²

4. Torque and Angular Momentum
- Torque (τ): τ = r × F
- Angular momentum (L): L = Iω
- Newton's second law for rotation: τ = Iα
- Conservation of angular momentum

5. Energy in Rotational Motion
- Rotational kinetic energy: K = ½Iω²
- Total kinetic energy: K = ½mv² + ½Iω²
- Work-energy theorem for rotation
- Power in rotational motion

6. Rolling Motion
- Rolling without slipping: v = rω
- Kinetic energy of rolling objects
- Friction in rolling motion
- Rolling resistance

7. Gyroscopic Motion
- Precession
- Nutation
- Gyroscopic stability
- Applications in navigation and control

8. Numerical Integration for Rotation
- Euler's method for angular motion
- Verlet integration for stability
- Quaternion representation for 3D rotation
- Avoiding gimbal lock

9. Applications in Games
- Spinning objects and projectiles
- Vehicle dynamics
- Character animation
- Physics-based puzzles
- Sports simulations
