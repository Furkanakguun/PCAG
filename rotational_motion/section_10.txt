1. Describing a rotating body
A rigid body’s attitude is fixed by an axis of rotation (a line + its positive direction) and a rotation angle θ.

Right-hand rule: point your right thumb along the + axis; your curled fingers show the positive sense of θ.

2. Angular kinematics
Angular velocity ω = dθ/dt (radians · s⁻¹).

Angular acceleration α = dω/dt.

A point at distance R from the axis has linear speed v = R ω – coffee mug on a turn-table moves slower near the centre than near the rim.

3. Moment of inertia (rotational inertia)
The rotational analogue of mass: I = Σ m r². Mass farther from the axis → larger I → harder to spin.

The slides list closed-form I for rods, disks, spheres, …

Parallel-axis theorem: I_O = I_cm + M s² (shift the axis by s from the centre of mass).

4. Newton’s rotational law

Torque τ = r × F. A door opens easier when you push at the handle (larger r → larger τ).

5. Energy split
A skateboarder translating (V) and flipping (ω) owns both terms.

6. Fixed vs. moving axes
Fixed axis: ceiling fan.

Moving axis: a baton in mid-air – the CM follows a parabola while the baton spins. With no external torque, ω stays constant.

7. Numerical integration (Euler)
omega += alpha*dt      # angular speed
theta += omega*dt      # angle
v     += a*dt          # CM velocity
r     += v*dt          # CM position
Ground contact modelled as a spring adds forces and torques.

8. Rotating sprites in Pygame
pygame.transform.rotate is quick but aliasing-prone.

The slides show a custom rot_center() helper that rotates an image and re-draws it at the same centre; each mouse click adds +3°.

9. Where you apply the force matters
Force through the CM → pure translation.

Offset force → translation and rotation. Hit a hammer at the handle: it flies forward and spins.
