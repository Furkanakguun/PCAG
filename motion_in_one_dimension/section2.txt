Motion in One Dimension
========================

1. Introduction to One-Dimensional Motion
One-dimensional motion is the simplest form of motion where an object moves along a straight line. This section covers the fundamental concepts of position, velocity, and acceleration in one dimension.

2. Key Concepts
- Position (x): Location of an object along a line
- Displacement (Δx): Change in position
- Velocity (v): Rate of change of position
- Acceleration (a): Rate of change of velocity

3. Kinematic Equations
For constant acceleration:
- v = v₀ + at
- x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at²
- v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀)

4. Free Fall
Objects under the influence of gravity alone:
- Acceleration due to gravity: g = 9.81 m/s²
- Downward direction is typically negative
- Air resistance is initially ignored

5. Numerical Integration
Euler's method for solving differential equations:
- x(t+Δt) = x(t) + v(t)Δt
- v(t+Δt) = v(t) + a(t)Δt

6. Data Analysis
- Reading experimental data from files
- Calculating velocity and acceleration from position data
- Plotting graphs to visualize motion

7. Applications in Games
- Character movement
- Projectile motion
- Physics-based animations
- Collision detection
